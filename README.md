Based on description from http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/redmine/project-sections

Redmine uses dummy projects as project categories. This leads to 'fake' projects that serve no other purpose but to hold subprojects.

This plugin allows projects to be assigned to sections in Redmine. Features and fuctionality available in this plugin are listed below.
* A category can be assigned to each project.
* Projects are grouped together in a list.
* A breadcrumb is displayed in the Redmine header.
* Each section has it's own page with a listing of projects in that section.
* Sections may also have sub-sections.
