Project Sections

Derived from http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/redmine/project-sections

Based on description from http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/redmine/project-sections

Redmine uses dummy projects as project categories. This leads to 'fake' projects that serve no other purpose but to hold subprojects.

This plugin adds the sections in Redmine, to which projects can be assigned. The project sections plugin provides the following features and fuctionality.
* A category can be assigned to each project.
* Projects are grouped together in a list.
* A breadcrumb is displayed in the Redmine header.
* Each section has it's own page with a listing of projects in that section.
* Sections may also have sub-sections.
